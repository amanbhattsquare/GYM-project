## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone #URL
    cd GYM-project/GYM
   

2.  **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
  
    .venv\Scripts\activate`
    

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up the database:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5.  **Create a superuser:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Usage

After running the server, you can access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
 Log in with the superuser credentials you created to access the admin and superadmin features.






1. Work Of Delete Button (usnig SweetAlert2- library)

User Clicks Delete: The process begins when you click the "Delete" button next to a member's name in the member list.
This action triggers the confirmDelete JavaScript function, passing the unique memberId of that member.

Confirmation Pop-up: The confirmDelete function then uses the SweetAlert2 library to display a confirmation pop-up,
asking if you are sure you want to delete the member. This prevents accidental deletions.

AJAX Request is Sent: If you confirm the deletion, the function sends an AJAX POST request to the server at the URL
/members/member/{memberId}/delete/. This request also includes a CSRF token to protect against cross-site request
forgery attacks.

URL Routing: Django receives the request and, based on the URL, routes it to the delete_member view in the members app.

Member Deletion: The delete_member view retrieves the corresponding member from the database using the memberId and
deletes the record.

JSON Response: After attempting to delete the member, the view returns a JsonResponse to the browser. This response
contains a status (e.g., "success" or "error") and a message.

Success or Error Message: The AJAX request in the browser receives this JsonResponse. If the status is "success," it
displays a success message using SweetAlert2 and then reloads the page to show the updated member list. If there was an
error, it displays an error message.






1. Here’s how you can use
`SweetAlert2` pop-ups on any other page in your project.

There are two main scenarios:

### 1. Displaying Messages from the Server (e.g., "Success!", "Error!")

This is the easiest part. Because we placed the core logic in `base.html`, this functionality is **automatically
available on any page that extends it.**

**How to use it:**

In any of your Django views (`views.py`), simply use the Django messages framework. The template will handle the rest.

**Example:** Let's say you create a new view to add an "enquiry."

```python
# In your views.py

from django.contrib import messages
from django.shortcuts import redirect

def add_enquiry_view(request):
# ... your logic to save the enquiry ...

# Add a success message
messages.success(request, 'The enquiry was successfully recorded!')

# Redirect to another page
return redirect('enquiry_list')
```

When the `enquiry_list` page loads, the message "The enquiry was successfully recorded!" will automatically appear in a
`SweetAlert2` pop-up, because `enquiry_list.html` extends `base.html`.

### 2. Creating Custom Confirmation Dialogs (like the "Delete" button)

If you want to create a new client-side confirmation pop-up on another page, you follow the same pattern we used for the
delete button.

**How to use it:**

1. **Extend `base.html`:** Make sure your new template (e.g., `other_page.html`) starts with `{% extends "base.html"
%}`.
2. **Add a Button:** Create the button or link that will trigger the pop-up.
3. **Use the `scripts` Block:** Add your custom JavaScript inside the `{% block scripts %}` at the bottom of your
template.

**Example:** Imagine you want to add an "Archive" button on a different page.

In your new template file (e.g., `archive_page.html`):

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
<h2>Archive Page</h2>
<p>Click the button below to archive the item.</p>

<!-- 1. The button that calls our new function -->
<button onclick="confirmArchive(123)">Archive Item</button>
{% endblock content %}


{% block scripts %}
<!-- 2. The custom JavaScript for this page -->
<script>
  function confirmArchive(itemId) {
    Swal.fire({
      title: 'Are you sure?',
      text: "This item will be archived.",
      icon: 'warning',
      showCancelButton: true,
      confirmButtonColor: '#3085d6',
      cancelButtonColor: '#d33',
      confirmButtonText: 'Yes, archive it!'
    }).then((result) => {
      if (result.isConfirmed) {
        // If confirmed, you can perform an AJAX call or redirect
        // For example:
        // window.location.href = `/archive/${itemId}/`;

        Swal.fire(
          'Archived!',
          'The item has been archived.',
          'success'
        );
      }
    });
  }
</script>
{% endblock scripts %}
```

Because `SweetAlert2` is loaded globally in `base.html`, you can immediately use the `Swal.fire()` function in any
script block on any page that extends it.
